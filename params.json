This is my personal and professional site. \r\n\r\nMy name is Rodrigo Jose to honor my two uncles Rodrigo and Jose.\r\nUsually I write my middle name as “J” in allusion to an episode of [_The Simpsons_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbw3L3Lu1R4). \r\n\r\nI was born in the [Colombian caribbean](https://www.google.fr/maps/@11.1286071,-74.5994455,10z). There, I lived part of my life and started my formation as Computer Engineer. I have also lived in Italy, France and Spain. Where I continued with graduate studies. \r\n\r\nIn all this lifetime, luck has been on my side and I have met wonderful people (friends, family, professors and colleges) who helped to tackle obstacle one can face. To them a big THANK YOU.\r\n\r\n### Disclaimer:\r\n> I have started this site while I had to write my PhD thesis too. As this is time demanding, I would slowly add professional content as well as blogging about cooking and spearfishing. Here is a video so you have a nice day:\r\n\r\n",
